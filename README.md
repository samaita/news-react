# Live Demo
You can access the **[Github Pages for News API](https://samaita.github.io/news-react/)**. If you want to see the APP with News API, there are several steps you need to do:
1. Since we are using CORS Proxy, please access [CORS Proxy by Rob--W](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) and enable it first.
2. **Precaution**, the API could still fail due to Cloudflare Captcha for CORS Proxy, so make sure your browser's cookie enabled.

# How To Run for devel
There are two way to run this app: Dynamic & Mock.
After run `npm install` you may choose to run as Dynamic or stay in Mock mode.

## Running as Dynamic
We are using News API as data source.

## Running as Mock
